<p>
Hey there! I'm {{ site.title }}, a software engineer bridging the vibrant worlds of Portugal and Portland, Oregon. With over 5 years of hands-on experience, I've delved deep into the art of crafting microservices and seamlessly hosting them on cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.
</p>

<p>
My journey in the tech realm has navigated me through the captivating landscape of healthtech, a domain where I've fine-tuned my expertise while actively contributing to impactful projects. What ignites my fervor in this ever-evolving field is not just the pursuit of top-notch code quality, but also an unwavering focus on observability and an unyielding commitment to enhancing developer quality of life. I thrive on crafting well-tested code, embracing TDD principles, and leveraging tools like Cucumber to ensure robustness and reliability in every line.

<p>
When I'm not crafting elegant code or exploring new tech projects, you might find me perfecting the art of brewing beer, sharing moments with my cherished family, or  playing music.
